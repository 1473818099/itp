## Things I know:
-	We can express the number 13 in bits. This works the same way as a decimal number. 

## Things I didnâ€™t know before:
-	A typical modern computer has more than 100 billion bits in its volatile data storage (working memory).
-	In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values.
-	Today, computers have plenty of memory, so you are free to use 64-bit chunks, and you need to worry about overflow only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.
-	Two special numbers: Infinity and -Infinity
